## WIESP DEAL

This is some version of the code that Iâ€™ve used in the paper [Domain specific augmentations as low cost teachers for large students](https://aclanthology.org/2022.wiesp-1.10) to train my model in 2022. 

As I have not maintained the code since, I highly doubt that the code works as some of the libraries have since been updated and I unfortunately do not recall which versions of the libraries I have installed back then.

I attach the code for completeness due to a recent request.

To use this code, please cite the following:
